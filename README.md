# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-ML
Machine Learning project for predicting breast cancer diagnosis using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. The models were evaluated and compared, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy.

#Dataset & Preprocessing
Used a labeled breast cancer dataset
Performed data cleaning and validation
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Applied feature scaling to improve model performance
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Proper preprocessing was essential to ensure reliable model evaluation and fair comparison between algorithms.

#Models Implemented
The following supervised learning algorithms were applied:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Each model was trained and evaluated on the same dataset to compare their classification performance.


#🛠 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
